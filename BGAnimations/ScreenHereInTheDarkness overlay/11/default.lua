-- I wish my mind could keep track of all my parts all the time.
--
-- Maybe I'd interact with other people less destructively. Maybe
-- I'd ruminate and obsess less. Maybe I'd finally find the words
-- to describe the recurring moment in which I find my mind back
-- in my body.
--
-- Maybe it's this disconnect that helps others find rest in sleep.
-- It seems like most people can laugh and forget, or at least let
-- go.
--
-- My body rests but my mind is on high alert. Actual nightmares
-- are infrequent, but there's always the worry that I'll find
-- myself back there and spend my dream hours fighting.
--
-- There is no way to describe the hours that follow a nightmare.
-- The specific details wither upon waking, but the residue of
-- unconscious panic lingers invisibly on my body during those
-- hours I am expected to be in control.
--
-- There is a heaviness to this that cannot be conveyed with words,
-- like how math can only model gravity but never feel it.

It overwhelms me so quickly, as though I am being filled with a terrible ocean.",

The way I got here again.\n\nEverything is gone, again and again, this moment violently torn away by the furious storm as a new one is swept in to replace it.",

I am motionless. Powerless. My bodily autonomy is gone. I want to scream, but I cannot. I want to fight back, but I cannot.\n\nPanic is wholly consuming, and all I can comprehend. I understand that I'm going to die like this, drowning in the still-rising sea inside me, and I cannot bear any more.",
	"And I don't.\n\nI'm suddenly free.\n\nAwake, in bed, vaguely aware that I have just screamed, I take note of how wet my face is,\ndoused in a mixture of sweat and saliva.\n\nI am shaken, but alive.",
