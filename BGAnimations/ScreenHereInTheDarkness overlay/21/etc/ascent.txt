I am interested in picking up where that left off and continuing the story.
And, as we know, any good journey begins by leaving the dark hallway you're
stuck in and exiting through an ominous door.

    take these ashes, me
    and grow something new

10 - leaving the hallway

the mysterious wall
9 - hearing xenium on the other side
8 - can you help me?
7 - silence, reflection

caleb
6 - meeting caleb, walking together
5 - kinder times, stronger together
4 - heavy talks, sunrise, caleb's suicide

ascent
3 - despair, darkness, lost in a continuous roar, upward, upward
2 - final ascent, view from the top, quietude before sunrise
1 - the color of hope as dawn breaks again
